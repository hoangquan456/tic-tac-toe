# tic-tac-toe

Odin project for tic-tac-toe. In  this project, I will try to implement the logic as neat as possible, just like this article: https://www.ayweb.dev/blog/building-a-house-from-the-inside-out. I realized from my previous project, library, that my I'm mixing a lot of DOM manipulation with the logic, which make development very difficult and inefficient.
